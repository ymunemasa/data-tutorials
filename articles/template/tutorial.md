# Sample Article (this is the title of your article)

## Introduction

This is the introductory paragraph for the tutorial.  This section will typically introduce the topic and the overall goals and objectives of the tutorial. A paragraph that introduces what technologies the user will learn to use in the tutorial to solve the problem for some use case.

## Prerequisites

-   [Title of a required tutorial to have been completed](http://example.com/link/to/required/tutorial)
-   [Another prerequisite](http://example.com/link/to/required/tutorial)

## Outline

-   [Concepts](#concepts)
-   [Section Title 1](#section-title-1)
-   [Section Title 2](#section-title-2)
-   [Summary](#summary)
-   [Further Reading](#further-reading)
-   [Appendix A: Troubleshoot](#appendix-a-troubleshoot)
-   [Appendix B: Extra Features](#appendix-b-extra-features)

> Note: It may be good idea for each procedure to start with an action verb (e.g. Install, Create, Implement, etc.)

## Concepts

Sometimes, it's a good idea to include a concepts section to go over core concepts before the real action begins.  That way:

-   Readers get a preview of the tech that'll be introduced.
-   The section can be used as a reference for terminology brought up throughout the tutorial.
-   By the way, this is an example of a list.  Feel free to copy/paste this for your own use.
    -   Also, a sublist.

## Section Title 1

One of the sections of the tutorial.

Also, `here is how to wrap text in a code field`.

```
You can also wrap multi-line
text in a code block by using
backticks.
```

> Note: This is a note that stands out to readers.  Catch users attention about image, command, or key concepts.

## Section Title 2

Another section of the tutorial.  **Here's an example** of some strong font, use sparingly.  Also, here is an image.

![An example of an image image](assets/some-image.png)

> Note: In the above image link, we link to an image in the included assets folder.  Put all of your assets (images, files, etc.) in that folder for easy linking to.  When your markdown gets built by the system, it will automatically link to the correct place on the web to find your images, downloadable files, etc.

## Summary

Congratulations, you've finished your first tutorial!  Including a review of the tutorial or tools they now know how to use would be helpful.

> Note: A tutorial does not go as in depth as documentation, so we suggest you include links here to all documents you may have utilized to build this tutorial.

### Appendix A: Troubleshoot

The appendix covers optional components of the tutorial, including help sections that might come up that cover common issues.  Either include possible solutions to issues that may occur or point users to [helpful links](https://hortonworks.com) in case they run into problems.

### Appendix B: Extra Features

Include any other interesting features of the big data tool you are using.

Example: when learning to build a NiFi flow, we included the necessary steps required to process the data. NiFi also has additional features for adding labels to a flow to make it easier to follow.
