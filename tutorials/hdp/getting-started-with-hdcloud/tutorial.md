# Getting Started with HDCloud

## Introduction

This tutorial will help you quickly spin-up a cloud environment where you can dynamically resize your cluster from one to hundreds of nodes. HDCloud is ideal for short-lived on-demand processing, allowing you to quickly perform heavy computation on large datasets. It gives you the ultimate control to allocate and de-allocate resources as needed.

In this tutorial we will focus on spinning up a Data Science persona environment that's ideally suited to our Apache Spark and Apache Zeppelin cloud-based tutorial series.

## Getting Started Videos

For a quick overview on how to get started with HDCloud, checkout these short three-part videos:

[Part 1 of 3](https://youtu.be/Q5ovR8YTFSg) - Setting up HDCloud Controller

[Part 2 of 3](https://youtu.be/yhFU-D0Uijw) - Setting up a three-node Cluster

[Part 3 of 3](https://youtu.be/YrEwOqbw7Is) - Launching Apache Ambari for operations and Apache Zeppelin for data wrangling and advanced analytics

## Environment Setup Details

Below are detailed steps behind the getting started videos:

1a. Create an [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account](https://aws.amazon.com/) if you don't have one

1b. Follow this step-by-step doc to [Setup and Launch a Controller on HDCloud](https://hortonworks.com/products/cloud/aws/)

1c. Create a *Data Science* [Cluster](https://hortonworks.github.io/hdp-aws/create/index.html) (use settings listed below)

Select/specify the following for your cluster:

  - HDP Version: HDP 2.6 or later
  - Cluster Type: "Data Science: Apache Spark 2.1+, Apache Zeppelin 0.6.2+" or later
  - Worker instance count: one or more
  - Remote Access: 0.0.0.0/0

Here's a screenshot with sample settings:
