The training set is what you actually use to build the model, whereas the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance afterwards on data that it has never encountered before. This is extremely important, because a model can have very high accuracy when evaluating training data but fail spectacularly when it encounters data it hasn't seen before.\n\nThis situation is called ***overfitting***. A good predictive model will build a generalized representation of your data in a way that reflects real things going on in your problem domain, and this generalization gives it predictive power. A model that overfits will instead try to predict the exact answer for each piece of your input data, and in doing so it will fail to generalize.

This is why it's important to always test your model against a validation set. \n\n#### Fixing overfitting: \n\nA little overfitting is usually expected and can often be ignored. If you see that your validation accuracy is very low compared to your training accuracy, you can fix this overfitting by either increasing the size of your training data or by decreasing the number of parameters in your model. By decreasing the number of parameters you decrease the model's ability to memorize large numbers of patterns.
